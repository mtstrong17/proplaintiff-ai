# ShadCN Component Integration Standards

## Overview
When creating new pages or components in the frontend, prioritize using shadcn components to maintain consistency and leverage pre-built accessible components. This rule defines the process for integrating shadcn components into the turborepo structure.

## Component Installation Process

### 1. Installation Command
Always install shadcn components using the following command structure from the root of the turborepo:
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```
Always run this command from the `apps/web` directory

### 2. Component Location
- Components will be installed in the `@workspace/ui/components` directory of your application
- Ensure the component is installed in the correct workspace package

### 3. Supported Components
Common components to consider:
- Button
- Card
- Dialog
- DropdownMenu
- Form
- Input
- Select
- Tabs
- Toast
- Toggle

## Best Practices

1. **Workspace Awareness**
   - Always run the installation command from the root of the turborepo
   - Ensure the correct workspace is targeted for component installation

2. **Component Reuse**
   - Before creating custom components, check if a shadcn component exists
   - Customize existing components through theming rather than creating new ones

3. **Styling**
   - Use the built-in theming system
   - Maintain consistency with the existing design system

## Examples

### Installing a Button Component
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
```

### Installing Multiple Components
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button card input
```

## Notes
- Always check the shadcn documentation for the latest component options
- Consider component dependencies when installing new components
- Keep track of installed components to avoid duplication
