# Rule Creation Standards

## File Structure

When creating new Cursor rules, always follow this structure:

1. Place rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Use `.mdc` file extension
3. Follow the numbered prefix convention:
   - Core Rules: 001-099
   - Integration Rules: 100-199
   - Pattern/Role Rules: 200-299

## Required Front Matter

Every rule file must include this YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
name: [Rule Name]
version: "1.0"
description: "[Brief description of the rule's purpose]"
globs: [Files/patterns this rule applies to]
triggers: [When this rule should be activated]
---
```

## Rule Content Structure

### 1. Title Section
Start with a clear H1 title describing the rule's purpose

### 2. Overview Section
Provide a brief explanation of what the rule does and why it exists

### 3. Main Content
- Use clear hierarchical structure with H2, H3 headers
- Include specific examples where applicable
- Use code blocks with language specification
- Keep instructions clear and actionable

### 4. Best Practices
- Write rules in clear, natural language
- Be specific and avoid ambiguity
- Include examples when possible
- Use markdown formatting for clarity

## Example Rule Structure

```markdown
---
name: Example Rule
version: "1.0"
description: "Description of the rule"
globs:
  - "relevant/file/patterns/**/*"
triggers:
  - relevant_trigger
---

## Validation

Before saving a new rule, ensure:
1. The file is properly named with numerical prefix
2. Front matter is complete and valid
3. Content is well-structured and formatted
4. Examples are included where helpful
5. The rule is placed in the correct directory

Remember that rules should be clear, specific, and actionable to ensure consistent application across the project.
