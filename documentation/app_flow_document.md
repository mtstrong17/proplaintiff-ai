# Proplaintiff-AI App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new legal professional first discovers Proplaintiff-AI, they are greeted with a clean, informative landing page. This page explains what the platform does and emphasizes its AI-powered tools for managing legal cases. New users are invited to create an account either through a simple email registration process or by using social media login options that integrate seamlessly, such as Google or LinkedIn. Once the registration form is filled out, the system sends a verification email to ensure the account is secure. Existing users can easily sign in using their credentials, and if they forget their password, the interface provides a clear link to initiate the recovery process through an email-based reset. Signing out from the platform is just as straightforward with a visible sign-out option available in the header of every page once logged in.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After successfully logging in, the user is directed to a well-organized main dashboard. This home page serves as the central hub where all important functions are easily accessible. At the top, there is a header that displays the organization’s name and a quick access menu, including notifications and user account settings. To the side, a sidebar offers navigation links to key areas such as case management, document uploads, AI insights, and subscription details. The dashboard is designed with intuitive widgets that show recent activities, new document uploads, and alerts about upcoming subscription renewals. All sections are clearly marked, enabling users to effortlessly move between different parts of the application without losing context of where they are or what they need to do next.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
After logging in and checking the dashboard, legal professionals begin their regular work by selecting an organization if they belong to more than one. The organization selection page is direct and allows users to switch contexts so that only the cases and documents for the chosen legal firm are displayed. Once an organization is selected, users may start a new case by accessing the case creation page. On this page, they enter case details such as the title, case number, and description using a clear form interface. After a case is created, they are taken to a detailed case overview where they can add more detailed metadata and even update the case information later.

When handling documents, users navigate to the document management area where they can drag-and-drop files or select them for upload. As soon as the document reaches the server, the platform automatically begins OCR processing using AWS Textract to extract text and metadata from the document. This extraction process is performed in the background and progress indicators keep users informed about the status. Once the OCR process is completed, all the extracted text along with additional document information is stored in a secure PostgreSQL database. Following this, the platform leverages AWS Bedrock and Langchain to analyze the text, generate case summaries, and highlight important legal points. The AI-generated insights are then linked to the related case and presented on the same dashboard in a dedicated insights section.

There are also advanced workflows for users like organization administrators where an admin panel is available. This panel is used to manage user roles, organization branding, and subscription settings. In situations where a premium subscription is active, additional details and tools become accessible to provide deeper analysis and more refined AI insights. Each step in the journey flows logically into the next, ensuring that whether a user is uploading a document or reviewing an AI summary, the transition is clear and all necessary information is available at every stage.

## Settings and Account Management
Within the user account section, legal professionals have the ability to manage their personal profiles such as updating their name, email address, and avatar. There is also an area dedicated to configuring notification preferences and adjusting security settings. For organization administrators, a separate settings page exists where they can update organization details and manage billing information. This includes subscription details managed via Stripe, where subscription status, plan type, and payment details are displayed and can be updated as needed. Users can easily navigate back to the main dashboard from these settings pages using a persistent navigation menu in the header, ensuring that they always return to a familiar work area after making adjustments.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
The application is built with user-friendly error handling at every stage. When a user enters invalid data during sign-in or case creation, clear error messages are shown right next to the form fields so that corrections can be made immediately. If the system loses connectivity during document uploads or while the AI processes documents, informative messages are displayed that recommend checking the internet connection and retrying the operation. Restricted actions, such as accessing admin settings without the proper permissions, trigger alerts that explain the restriction without revealing sensitive details. In each error state, users are provided with a way to navigate back or refresh the process, ensuring that the workflow remains smooth and that recovery is quick.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the moment a legal professional signs up through the straightforward account creation, Proplaintiff-AI guides the user through every step of managing legal cases. Once on the intuitive main dashboard, users can easily switch between their organizations, create new cases, upload documents, and generate insightful AI analyses.
