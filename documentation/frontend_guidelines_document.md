# Frontend Guideline Document

Welcome to the Proplaintiff-AI Frontend Guideline Document. This document explains our frontend setup in everyday language, covering the architecture, design principles, styling, component structure, state management, routing, performance optimizations, and testing. Whether you are a developer, a designer, or a stakeholder, this guide provides a clear understanding of our approach.

## Frontend Architecture

Our frontend is built on Next.js with TypeScript and React. This means we use a modern framework that supports both server-side rendering and static site generation, helping us deliver fast, efficient, and SEO-friendly pages.

Here’s how our architecture supports our goals:

*   **Scalability:** Using a monorepo managed with pnpm and turbo, we keep our code organized and ready to grow. The component-based design ensures that new features can be added without disrupting the existing code.
*   **Maintainability:** With Next.js and TypeScript, the code is strongly typed and easy to read. We employ tRPC for smooth communication between the frontend and backend, meaning our system stays robust as changes are made.
*   **Performance:** React, along with TanStack React Query, allows us to fetch, cache, and update data efficiently. Code splitting and lazy loading ensure that only the necessary parts of an app load, resulting in a snappy user experience.

## Design Principles

Our design focuses on making the user interface as friendly and accessible as possible:

*   **Usability:** Everything in our UI is designed with the user in mind. From clear navigation to intuitive interactions, we make sure the platform is easy to use for legal professionals.
*   **Accessibility:** We adhere to accessibility best practices. This means text is readable, buttons are easy to click, and the design works well with screen readers.
*   **Responsiveness:** Our design adapts to various screen sizes—from desktops to mobiles—ensuring a consistent experience wherever it is used.
*   **Consistency:** A unified visual language is maintained across the entire application, making every page feel like part of one coherent system.

## Styling and Theming

Our styling and theming strategy are designed to provide a modern, professional look while ensuring a consistent user experience:

*   **Styling Approach:** We use Tailwind CSS as our primary styling tool, along with the Class Variance Authority (cva) and tailwind-merge for managing and merging styles. This approach is inspired by CSS methodologies like BEM and helps us maintain clear and efficient code.

*   **Theming:** The project uses Next Themes to manage light and dark modes. This means that the UI automatically adapts based on user preferences and branding. We support custom branding with light/dark logos, especially for organization settings.

*   **Design Style:** Our UI follows a modern design that mixes flat and material design influences with hints of glassmorphism to create a sleek, contemporary look. The overall vibe is professional and cutting-edge.

*   **Color Palette:**

    *   Primary: #2563EB (Blue)
    *   Secondary: #10B981 (Green)
    *   Background (Light): #F9FAFB
    *   Background (Dark): #1F2937
    *   Accent: #F59E0B (Amber)
    *   Neutral: #6B7280 (Gray)

*   **Font:** When no specific font is provided, we use system fonts optimized for digital reading (like the default fonts on MacOS, Windows, etc.) with fallback to the widely appreciated "Inter" font due to its modern, readable design.

## Component Structure

Our frontend follows a component-based architecture, meaning each piece of the UI is broken down into small, reusable parts, or components.

*   **Organization:** Components are organized in a clear, hierarchical manner. For example, buttons, form fields, and layout components are grouped together in a UI package (packages/ui) and are reused throughout the application.
*   **Reusability:** This structure not only makes the code easy to manage, but also speeds up development because common elements are built once and then adapted as needed.
*   **Maintainability:** By having small, isolated components, bugs are easier to find and fix, and new updates can be integrated without a complete overhaul.

## State Management

For managing data and ensuring a smooth user experience, our project uses multiple strategies:

*   **Server Data:** We use TanStack React Query to fetch, cache, and update server data. This means that data flows naturally between the frontend and backend while staying fresh and fast.
*   **Global State:** For app-wide states like user authentication and theme settings, we rely on React’s built-in context along with some custom hooks where necessary.
*   **tRPC:** Our use of tRPC bridges the gap between the frontend and the backend, ensuring that data is correctly validated and typed, reducing the chance of bugs and improving overall reliability.

## Routing and Navigation

Navigation in our application is intuitive and easy to follow:

*   **Routing Method:** We use Next.js’s file-based routing. This system maps URLs directly to the file structure, making it simple to add or modify pages.
*   **Navigation Structure:** The app’s navigation reflects its step-by-step flow—from user authentication, organization selection, and case creation, to document upload and AI-powered analysis. Users can easily move between these parts using clearly marked menus and buttons.

## Performance Optimization

We’ve built performance into our frontend right from the start:

*   **Lazy Loading:** Components and assets are lazy-loaded, meaning that only the necessary parts of the code are loaded initially. This technique dramatically speeds up the initial page load.
*   **Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code into smaller bundles, ensuring that the browser only downloads what it needs.
*   **Asset Optimization:** Images and fonts are optimized, and unused CSS is purged, leading to a faster overall experience for users.
*   **Caching:** Utilizing TanStack React Query, we cache responses so that repeat visits or interactions happen almost instantly.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

To keep our frontend reliable and bug-free, we follow robust testing practices:

*   **Unit Testing:** Each component is tested individually to ensure it performs as expected. Tools like Jest are used to automate these tests.
*   **Integration Testing:** We ensure that different parts of the software work together smoothly, simulating common user actions.
*   **End-to-End Testing:** Full user flows are tested using frameworks like Cypress to verify that the entire user journey—from login to document processing and case analysis—works flawlessly.
*   **Linting and Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier are set up to enforce a consistent code style, making the codebase easier to read and maintain.

## Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary
