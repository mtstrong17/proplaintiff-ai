# Tech Stack Document

This document walks you through the different technology choices made for the Proplaintiff-AI project. The aim is to explain each part in plain, everyday language so you can see how everything works together to create a reliable, efficient, and secure platform.

## Frontend Technologies

Our platform’s frontend is the part you see and interact with. We selected tools that not only make the interface attractive and smooth but also ensure it is robust and user-friendly. Here are the choices:

*   **Next.js with TypeScript**: This offers a fast and responsive website, combining server-side power with a modern user interface.
*   **React**: Helps build interactive user interfaces, making the experience intuitive for legal professionals.
*   **tRPC**: Provides a reliable and type-safe way to communicate with the backend without worrying about mismatches or hidden errors.
*   **TanStack React Query**: Optimizes data fetching and caching, ensuring that information on your dashboard loads quickly and updates smoothly.
*   **Shadcn/ui**: A dedicated UI component library that speeds up design, making sure that all elements look consistent and professional.
*   **Next Themes**: This tool easily manages light and dark mode themes, so the platform adapts to user preferences for comfort and accessibility.
*   **Lucide React**: Supplies a collection of icons that make navigation and displays clearer and more visually appealing.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is the engine behind the scenes. It handles data, manages processes, and connects all parts of the system. We’ve chosen a stack that makes the platform secure, efficient, and scalable:

*   **Node.js with TypeScript**: Forms the backbone of our backend, combining speed with reliability while ensuring that code errors are caught early thanks to TypeScript.
*   **Fastify**: This web framework helps build our API (the set of rules that allow different parts of the system to talk to each other) swiftly and efficiently.
*   **tRPC**: Used again on the backend to ensure smooth and type-safe communication between client and server.
*   **Drizzle ORM**: This is a tool that makes interacting with our database (PostgreSQL) straightforward and safe. It manages queries and helps prevent errors.
*   **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source database that stores all the critical information like user data, organization details, case files, and more.
*   **AWS SDK**: Lets our platform talk to Amazon Web Services, which powers many tasks like storing documents (S3), processing OCR (Textract), and running AI analysis (Bedrock).
*   **Langchain**: A tool designed for integrating AI language models. This helps in analyzing texts, extracting key points, and generating case insights.
*   **Zod**: Used for validating data structures. It ensures that the information being processed is correct and meets expectations.
*   **ulidx, dotenv, cors, superjson**: These tools help with generating unique IDs, managing environment variables, handling data sharing between different platforms, and ensuring data serialization runs smoothly.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Our infrastructure choices ensure that the platform is reliable, scalable, and easy to update, all while keeping everything secure:

*   **Monorepo Structure with pnpm and turbo**: This keeps the whole project (backend, frontend, and UI components) neatly organized in one place, making development and maintenance simpler.
*   **Cloud Services and AWS**: The use of AWS services like S3, Textract, and Bedrock means we rely on proven, scalable cloud solutions to store documents, extract text, and power AI operations.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Though not detailed here, our project embraces modern deployment practices so that when changes are made, they can be tested and updated automatically. This minimizes downtime and errors when the platform goes live.
*   **Version Control Systems**: Using tools (like Git) ensures that every change is tracked, letting teams collaborate smoothly and safely.

## Third-Party Integrations

We integrated several third-party services to extend our platform’s capabilities and provide a smoother experience:

*   **AWS Services**:

    *   *S3*: For secure and scalable file storage.
    *   *Textract*: For reliable OCR (text extraction from legal documents).
    *   *Bedrock*: Powers our AI, providing intelligent insights from case documents.

*   **Stripe**: Manages subscriptions and payment processing, ensuring that billing and customer management are handled with industry-grade security and efficiency.

These integrations allow us to leverage best-in-class services without reinventing the wheel.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are crucial, especially given the sensitive nature of legal documents. Here’s how we address these:

*   **User Authentication and Authorization**: Our backend is built with secure methods to verify and manage access, ensuring only authorized legal professionals can access sensitive information.
*   **Data Protection**: Data stored in PostgreSQL and transmitted via APIs is managed carefully with encryption and validated using Zod to keep the information safe.
*   **AWS Security Features**: Using AWS means benefitting from their robust security infrastructure, ensuring that document storage and processing remain secure.
*   **Optimized Data Fetching**: Tools like TanStack React Query and tRPC help minimize delays and load times, making sure that users experience swift interactions even when handling large data sets.
*   **Reliable Code Quality Tools**: ESLint and Prettier keep our codebase clean and error-free, contributing to both security and performance by reducing bugs that could affect the user experience.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the tech stack for Proplaintiff-AI has been chosen to balance cutting-edge functionality with ease of use and security:

*   **Frontend**: Combines Next.js, React, and modern UI libraries to make a user-friendly, responsive interface that adapts to user needs (including theme management and efficient data display).
*   **Backend**: Uses Node.js with TypeScript, Fastify, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL to provide a solid, efficient backbone that reliably manages data and processes user requests.
*   **Infrastructure**: Relies on a smart monorepo structure paired with proven cloud services (via AWS) and effective deployment pipelines to ensure that the platform is scalable and maintains high uptime.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: Incorporates powerful external services like AWS, Stripe, and dedicated AI tools to offer comprehensive functionality without compromising security.
*   **Security and Performance**: Through robust authentication, data validation, and advanced cloud security services, the platform is well-prepared to handle sensitive legal information while providing fast and reliable user experiences.

This thoughtfully selected tech stack not only meets the demands of legal professionals but also provides a secure, scalable, and efficient solution that stands out in today’s competitive landscape.
