# Proplaintiff-AI Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step guide and implementation plan for Proplaintiff-AI, an AI-powered legal platform for plaintiff legal professionals. This plan emphasizes security by design, performance, scalability, and compliance with legal regulations.

---

## 1. Project Planning & Architectural Design

- **Define Project Scope**
  - Confirm core features: User Management, Organization Management, Case Management, Document Management, AI-Powered Insights, and Subscription Management.
  - Identify non-functional requirements: performance, scalability, security, compliance, and accessibility.

- **Architecture Design & Technology Stack Confirmation**
  - Establish a monorepo structure using `pnpm` and `turbo`.
  - Finalize the split of responsibilities between the frontend (`apps/web`) and backend (`apps/api`).
  - Define communication mechanisms (e.g., tRPC, REST, GraphQL) with a focus on robust authentication and API security.

- **Security by Design Considerations**
  - Evaluate input validation, output encoding, and fail-safe mechanisms for each component.
  - Plan for least privilege access across components and ensure secure defaults are applied.
  - Identify potential risks (e.g., AWS API rate limits, OCR accuracy, data handling of sensitive legal documents) and incorporate mitigations in design.

---

## 2. Infrastructure Setup & Configuration Management

- **Repository & Development Environment**
  - Set up a monorepo with designated folders: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `packages/ui`.
  - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript across the monorepo to ensure code quality and consistency.

- **Environment Preparation**
  - Establish environment-specific configurations via `.env` files and secure secrets management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
  - Harden server configurations: disable debug features in production and apply secure file permissions.
  - Configure TLS settings for both frontend and backend servers ensuring TLS 1.2+.

- **Cloud & Service Integrations**
  - Set up AWS resources: S3 (for document storage), Textract (OCR processing), and Bedrock (for AI analysis).
  - Integrate with Stripe for organization subscription management.
  - Prepare PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and configure restricted access with encryption at rest and in transit.

## 3. Core Feature Development

### A. User & Organization Management

- **User Management**
  - Implement secure registration and authentication using Next.js with strong password policies (Argon2/bcrypt for hashing with unique salts).
  - Incorporate secure session management (e.g., unpredictable session IDs, HttpOnly cookies, session timeouts, and provisions for MFA where required).
  - Establish role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce least privilege for accessing sensitive endpoints.

- **Organization Management**
  - Provide capabilities for creating organizations with unique branding (logos, etc.).
  - Ensure organizational association for each user. Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### B. Case Management

- **Case Creation & Management**
  - Implement endpoints for case creation and metadata management.
  - Use tRPC and Fastify with Zod validations to ensure that all data inputs are rigorously validated and sanitized.
  - Enforce RBAC to ensure only authorized users can create, view, or update case records.

### C. Document Management

- **File Upload & Storage**
  - Implement secure file upload mechanisms ensuring file type, size, and content validations.
  - Route uploads securely to AWS S3, storing files outside of the webroot where possible and using restricted permissions.
  - Protect against path traversal and other file upload attacks.

- **OCR Processing (AWS Textract)**
  - Integrate AWS Textract to process uploaded legal documents.
  - Implement asynchronous processing and queue management in the backend to manage high loads and AWS rate limits.
  - Validate and sanitize data extracted from documents to prepare inputs for AI analysis.

### D. AI-Powered Insights

- **AI Integration**
  - Integrate AWS Bedrock and Langchain to analyze legal documents and generate case insights.
  - Process AI-generated outputs to include summaries, key points, document citations, and confidence scores.
  - Validate and display insights securely in the UI, ensuring that error messages do not expose sensitive information.

### E. Subscription Management

- **Stripe Integration**
  - Setup endpoints for subscription management and billing data using Stripe.
  - Validate all API inputs and sanitize data to prevent injection or credential stuffing.
  - Use secure webhooks and verify Stripe signatures to ensure authenticity of events.

## 4. Frontend Development (apps/web)

- **User Interface Implementation**
  - Build the UI using Next.js with TypeScript, React, and Shadcn/ui components along with TanStack React Query for data fetching and state management.
  - Enforce security headers, proper theming (using Next Themes), and secure cookie practices.
  - Use security measures such as CSP, X-Frame-Options, and secure client-side storage best practices.

- **Integration with Backend**
  - Implement communication with the backend via tRPC, ensuring that all API requests are authenticated and authorized.
  - Use proper error handling and logging, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked in logs or error messages.

- **Accessibility & Performance**
  - Ensure that the UI meets accessibility standards and that performance best practices are in place (e.g., code splitting, lazy loading).

---

## 5. End-to-End Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit & Integration Testing**
  - Write unit tests for frontend and backend components using reputable test frameworks.
  - Employ integration tests to verify correct interactions between UI, API, AWS services, and Stripe.

- **Security Testing**
  - Conduct vulnerability scans and perform static code analysis using SCA tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - Run penetration tests focusing on authentication, file uploads, API endpoints, and input validation.

- **Performance & Load Testing**
  - Simulate high load conditions and stress test the application to evaluate scalability and performance under heavy usage.

---

## 6. Deployment & Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **Deployment Strategy**
  - Adopt a CI/CD pipeline with security checks integrated at every stage (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI).
  - Ensure automated static analysis, dependency scanning, and unit/integration tests pass before deployment.

- **Environment Segregation**
  - Configure separate environments for development, staging, and production, applying secure defaults in every configuration.
  - Secure infrastructure access with least privilege policies and proper network segmentation.

- **Monitoring & Incident Response**
  - Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to capture anomalies and potential security events.
  - Establish incident response procedures to rapidly address potential breaches or service failures.

---

## 7. Post-Deployment & Maintenance

- **Regular Updates & Patch Management**
  - Schedule routine maintenance to update dependencies, patch vulnerabilities, and monitor AWS rate limits.
  - Re-assess security configurations periodically and adjust based on the latest security guidelines.

- **User Feedback & Iterative Enhancements**
  - Gather user feedback to improve the platform while ensuring all changes are reviewed for security impact.
  - Audit system performance, scalability, and UX improvements regularly.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan for Proplaintiff-AI follows secure coding practices and emphasizes defense in depth at every layerâ€”from frontend inputs to backend processing and cloud integrations. By prioritizing security, performance, and scalability, the application aims to provide legal professionals with a reliable platform for managing sensitive legal documents and obtaining actionable insights.

*Note: All implementations should be continuously reviewed against evolving security best practices and compliance regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) to ensure ongoing protection and resilience against new threats.*
