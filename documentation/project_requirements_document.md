# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

Proplaintiff-AI is an AI-powered platform designed specifically for legal professionals working on plaintiff cases. The platform streamlines the process of managing legal documents through automated document processing, OCR-based text extraction, and AI-generated case insights. It is built as a monorepo using pnpm and turbo, combining a secure and efficient API backend with an intuitive web frontend. This system aims to reduce manual effort, lower administrative overhead, and help legal teams quickly gather critical information from case documents.

The platform is being built to meet the growing need for digital efficiency in the legal field. By automating document uploads, data extraction, and AI-driven analysis, Proplaintiff-AI helps legal professionals focus on more strategic case preparation. Key success criteria include fast response times, a scalable design for managing multiple organizations and cases, strict security for sensitive information, and compliance with legal regulations. The ultimate objective is to enhance workflow efficiency and improve case outcomes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   User management with registration, authentication, and profile updates.
*   Organization management including organization creation, role management, and branding (light/dark logos).
*   Case management with a structured repository for legal case details.
*   Document management with secure upload, storage on AWS S3, and metadata tracking.
*   OCR integration using AWS Textract to extract text from uploaded documents.
*   AI-powered insights using AWS Bedrock and Langchain to generate case summaries and key legal points.
*   Integration with Stripe for subscription and billing management.
*   A monorepo structure to manage and deploy the API backend, web frontend, and UI components.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced offline features or mobile-specific applications; the initial version is a web-based platform.
*   Extensive customization of the UI beyond the provided Shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS frameworks.
*   Support for document types outside of standard legal formats (e.g., specialized non-text documents) unless specified later.
*   Any additional AI processing not directly related to case insights, such as sentiment analysis for non-legal documents.
*   Integrations with third-party services beyond AWS and Stripe for the first version.

## 3. User Flow

When a legal professional accesses Proplaintiff-AI, they start by signing in on a secure login page where their credentials are verified. Once signed in, they are automatically linked to their legal organization, ensuring that only permitted users can access the system. If the professional belongs to multiple organizations, they are prompted to select the appropriate law firm or case specialty area to tailor their experience.

After organization selection, the user is directed to a dashboard where they can create a new legal case by entering essential details like the case title, number, and description. Once a case is created, the user uploads legal documents via an intuitive drag-and-drop or file selection interface. The documents are stored securely on AWS S3, processed by OCR using AWS Textract, and the extracted text along with other metadata is saved in a PostgreSQL database. The system then leverages AI services to analyze the data, producing case summaries and insights that are displayed on the dashboard alongside the original document content.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The platform is heavily dependent on AWS services (S3, Textract, Bedrock). It is assumed that these services are available and their pricing fits within the project budget.
*   The initial scope focuses on a web-based interface; mobile applications or offline functionality are not expected for the first version.
*   The system is built using a monorepo structure with pnpm and turbo, so a consistent development environment across teams is assumed.
*   It is assumed that the legal professionals using the platform have basic technology proficiency, which informs the level of UI complexity.
*   The integration with external payment systems (Stripe) is assumed to be straightforward, without requiring extensive customization in the initial version.
*   Availability of key libraries and frameworks (e.g., Langchain, Fastify) is taken for granted, with the understanding that updates or deprecations might require future adjustments.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Service Latency:**

    *   AWS Textract and Bedrock may have rate limits or latency issues that could impact processing speed. Consider implementing retries, caching, or alternative processing methods to handle bursts in usage.

*   **Document Processing Complexity:**

    *   OCR accuracy might differ across document types or quality issues with scans. Prompt error handling and user notifications are essential to manage expectations.

*   **Data Security Challenges:**

    *   Given the sensitivity of legal documents, ensuring end-to-end security is critical. Misconfigurations in AWS security settings or API vulnerabilities could expose data.

*   **Subscription and Billing Integration:**

    *   Managing integration with Stripe involves handling sensitive billing data and remains a potential challenge, especially in edge cases like payment failures or subscription changes.

*   **Scaling and Performance:**

    *   As the platform grows, ensuring the backend and database handle increased load without compromising on response times will be important. Optimized database queries and load testing can help mitigate risks.

*   **AI Insight Accuracy:**

    *   The effectiveness of AI-generated insights may vary based on document complexity. Regular monitoring, user feedback, and iterative safeguards are necessary to maintain reliability and trustworthiness of the outputs.
